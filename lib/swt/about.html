<h4>Independent JPEG Group's JPEG software release 6b</h4>

<p>This software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group's JPEG software release 6b (&quot;LIBJPEG&quot;).
LIBJPEG was used to implement the decoding of JPEG format files in Java (TM).  The Content does NOT include any portion of the LIBJPEG file ansi2knr.c.</p>

<p>Your use of LIBJPEG is subject to the terms and conditions located in the <a href="about_files/IJG_README">about_files/IJG_README</a> file which is included
with the Content.</p>

<p>The IJG's website is located at <a href="http://ijg.org/" target="_blank">http://ijg.org</a>.</p>

<p>The class org.eclipse.swt.internal.image.JPEGFileFormat is based on following files from LIBJPEG:</p>

<ul>

<p>The following changes were made to the LIBJPEG code in the Content:</p>

<ol>
	<li>In Java, pointer math is not allowed so indexing was used instead.</li>
	<li>Function pointers were replaced with switch statements.</li>
	<li>The virtual memory, tracing and progress monitoring were removed.</li>
	<li>The error handling was simplified and now uses Java exceptions.</li>
</ol>
