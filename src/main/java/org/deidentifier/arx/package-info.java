/**
 * This package provides the public API for the ARX anonymization framework.
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>The class {@link AttributeType} encapsulates the four different kinds of attributes recognized by the framework.</li>
 * <li>The class {@link DataType} encapsulates the three different kinds of data types recognized by the framework.</li>
 * <li>The class {@link Data} represents an input dataset for the algorithm.</li>
 * <li>The class {@link DataDefinitio}, an instance of which can be obtain for any input data by calling {@link Data.getDefinition()}, allows assign attribute types, data types and further parameters to a dataset.</li>
 * <li>The class {@link DataHandle}, an instance of which can be obtain for any input data by calling {@link Data.getHandle()} and for any output data by calling {@link ARXResult.getHandle()}, implements convenience methods for accessing a dictionary encoded representation of a dataset. It also allows manipulating the data (e.g., sorting it) and makes sure that input and output data are always in sync.</li>
 * <li>The class {@link ARXAnonymizer} represents the actual algorithm and allows to derive anonymous representations of the input dataset, e.g., by calling {@link ARXAnonymizer.kAnonymize()} or {@link ARXAnonymizer.lDiversify()}.</li>
 * <li>The class {@link ARXResult} represents the results of executing the algorithm. It provides access to the globally optimal solution and the underlying generalization lattice {@link ARXLattice}.</li>
 * <li>The class {@link ARXAdapter} can be utilized to attach a listener to the ARX framework, tracking its progress while anonymizing a dataset.</li>
