/**
 * This package implements different variants of class-based privacy criteria,
 * such as k-anonymity, l-diversity, t-closeness and d-presence. <br>
 * <br> 
 * Moreover, this package implements sample-based criteria, such as thresholds on
 * the average re-identification risk, population uniqueness and sample uniqueness. <br>
 * <br>
 * k-anonymity and d-presence and the sample-based criteria are implicit privacy criteria, i.e., they 
 * are implicitly bound to the quasi-identifiers, while the other criteria are explicitly bound to a 
 * specific sensitive attribute. <br>
