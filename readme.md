Introduction
------

ARX is a comprehensive open source software for de-identifying sensitive personal data. 
It has been designed from the ground up to provide high scalability, ease of use and a 
tight integration of the many different aspects relevant to data anonymization. Its highlights include:

 * Utility-focused anonymization using different statistical models
 * Syntactic privacy models, such as k-anonymity, ℓ-diversity, t-closeness and δ-presence
 * Semantic privacy models, such as (ɛ, δ)-differential privacy
 * Methods for optimizing the profitability of data publishing based on monetary cost-benefit analyses
 * Data transformation with generalization, suppression, microaggregation and top/bottom coding as well as global and local recoding
 * Methods for analyzing data utility
 * Methods for analyzing re-identification risks

The software is able to handle very large datasets on commodity hardware and features an intuitive cross-platform 
graphical user interface. You can find further information on the project [website](https://arx.deidentifier.org/). 

Development setup
------

Currently, the main development of ARX is carried out using Eclipse as an IDE and Ant as a build tool. Support for further IDEs such as IntelliJ IDEA and Maven is experimental.

The Ant build script features various targets that can be used to build different versions of ARX (e.g. including GUI code or not). To build only the core code using Maven, set the system property `core` to `true`. This will build a platform independent jar with the ARX main code module and no GUI components. For example,

```$ mvn compile -Dcore=true```
