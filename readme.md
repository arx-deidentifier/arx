ARX - Powerful Data Anonymization
====

ARX is a comprehensive open source software for de-identifying sensitive personal data. 
It has been designed from the ground up to provide high scalability, ease of use and a 
tight integration of the many different aspects relevant to data anonymization. Its highlights include:

 * Risk-based anonymization using different statistical models
 * Syntactic privacy models, such as k-anonymity, ℓ-diversity, t-closeness and δ-presence
 * Semantic privacy models, such as (ɛ, δ)-differential privacy
 * Data transformation with generalization, suppression, microaggregation and top/bottom coding as well as global and local recoding
 * Methods for analyzing data utility
 * Methods for analyzing re-identification risks

The software is able to handle very large datasets on commodity hardware and features an intuitive cross-platform 
graphical user interface. You can find further information on our [website](http://arx.deidentifier.org/).
